This notebook offers an in-depth analysis of sales data from an e-commerce business, comprising over half a million records across nine columns. It addresses various key questions about the business, including overall sales trends, best-selling products in different countries, monthly customer acquisition rates, and peak purchase times.

Utilizing Plotly Express for interactive graphs, Seaborn for heatmaps, and Matplotlib for figure formatting, the analysis provides comprehensive insights into the business's performance. The dataset used is a refined version of the original, with cleaning procedures involving data validation, removal of duplicates, and outlier management.

In summary, this notebook serves as a valuable resource for understanding the sales dynamics and strategic decision-making processes within the e-commerce domain.
